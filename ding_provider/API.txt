Ding provider interface
=======================

The ding_provider module is the bridge between Ding and different
backend data and service providers.

Usage
=====

Using a provider
----------------

There's only 2 functions for using providers:

ding_provider_exists($type)
  Checks whether a provider type is active. Useful for conditionals.

ding_provider_invoke($type, $function, ...)
  Invoke a function in a provider. Additional arguments are used as
  arguments for the provider function.

The functions, arguments, return value and documentation of a given
provider type should be available in provider_docs/PROVIDER.api.php.

Creating a provider
-------------------

Providers are standard CTools plugins. The different types of
providers and their functions are documented in
provider_docs/PROVIDER.api.php.

Common for all provider types is the 'version' and 'description' keys
of the plugin definition.

The 'version' property tells which API version the plugin is
compatible with, using the same logic of hook_ctools_plugin_api. This
should be set to the value of the DING_PROVIDER_VERSION define in the
current version of ding_provider.

 The 'description' property is displayed as information to the
administrator on the admin page, and should have human friendly
content.
